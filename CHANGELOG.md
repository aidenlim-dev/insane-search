# Changelog

## 1.1.1 - 2026-07-16

Upstream fix incorporated (insane-search 0.9.2): cross-platform yt-dlp invocation - the YouTube / media route no longer misreports an installed yt-dlp as missing.

- **`engine/phase0.py`**: the YouTube Phase-0 route invoked yt-dlp only as the bare `yt-dlp` console script. With `pip install --user` and on Windows / venv installs the script dir is commonly absent from PATH, so `subprocess.run` raised `FileNotFoundError` and the route reported `"yt-dlp not installed"` even though yt-dlp was installed and importable - silently disabling the headline media route (1,858 sites) for those users. New `_ytdlp_argv()` prefers the `yt-dlp` console script on PATH and falls back to `<python> -m yt_dlp`, mirroring the `which yt-dlp || python3 -m yt_dlp` fallback already documented in `references/media.md`. Non-regressive: environments with `yt-dlp` on PATH are unchanged.
- **`tests/coverage_battery.py`**: the youtube battery uses the same resolution.
- **`engine/bias_check.py`**: the `EXPLICIT_ALLOW_FILES` exemption compared `str(rel)`, which is backslash-separated on Windows and therefore never matched the POSIX-style allow-list - so the sanctioned `phase0.py` exemption silently failed and the No-Site-Name gate reported false positives when run on Windows. Now compares `rel.as_posix()`. No behaviour change on POSIX.
- Adds network-free regression tests in `engine/tests/test_u10.py` (upstream numbers this suite U9; renumbered here because this fork's U9 already covers Playwright tier routing).

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-05

Codex support, ported from the Codex-first rewrite (`sinmb79/codex-insane-search`).

- **Codex-native manifests**: added `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (with full `interface` metadata — display name, default prompts, brand color, icon) and a repo-local `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, alongside the existing Claude manifests. New `assets/icon.svg`.
- **Codex local install scripts**: `setup/codex-install-local.ps1` junctions a clone into `~/plugins/aioffice-searchpro` and registers it in `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (source-of-truth stays in the repo); `setup/codex-uninstall-local.ps1` reverses both.
- **SKILL.md Codex compatibility section**: plugin-root resolution when `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is absent (resolve relative to SKILL.md), Claude→Codex tool-name mapping (WebFetch→`web.open`, WebSearch→`web.search_query`, shell→`shell_command`), and Codex update commands.
- **Docs**: Codex install commands (`codex plugin marketplace add` / `codex plugin add`) in all README languages and the course install guide.
- **Jina rate-limit correction** (from the Codex rewrite): `references/jina.md` now states 20 RPM without an API key and 500 RPM with a free key, instead of claiming 500 RPM keyless.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-07-05

Post-install clarity: no stray clones, and a doctor summary that tells users (and agents) exactly what's optional.

- **Doctor summary block**: `doctor.ps1`/`doctor.sh` now end with `=== doctor summary ===` separating CORE readiness from the OPTIONAL browser fallback, including exact enable steps and an explicit note that agents must ask before installing Node.js or MCP servers.
- **No-clone verification**: docs now point doctor runs at the installed marketplace copy (`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/aioffice-searchpro-marketplace`), so agents stop cloning a second copy of the repo into the user's home directory just to verify.
- **Consent-gated Node install**: `setup/browser.ps1 -InstallNode` (winget) and `setup/browser.sh --install-node` (Homebrew) let the browser-fallback setup install Node.js in one step — gated behind an explicit flag that agents pass only after user consent.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-05

Agent-driven install hardening: "throw the repo link at Claude Code and say install" now works first-try on stock Windows.

- **Agent install path**: READMEs (all languages) and `COURSE_INSTALL.ko.md` now document the non-interactive CLI (`claude plugin marketplace add` / `claude plugin install`) for AI agents, which cannot run the interactive `/plugin` slash commands and previously reverse-engineered settings files instead.
- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatibility**: `run-engine.ps1`, `browser.ps1`, and `live-check.ps1` no longer use `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`, which on 5.1 promoted harmless native stderr output (e.g. `python -m venv` warnings) to terminating errors; every native call already checks `$LASTEXITCODE`. Docs, `SKILL.md`, and doctor hints now invoke scripts via `powershell` (built into every Windows) instead of `pwsh` (PowerShell 7, often absent).
- **Venv self-repair**: `run-engine.ps1` now treats a venv missing its interpreter as failed, removes the partial venv, and retries once before erroring, instead of leaving a broken venv for the next run.

Project rename to AIOFFICE-SearchPro.

- **Repository identity**: renamed the public-facing project from the old name to `AIOFFICE-SearchPro`, with repository links updated to `aidenlim-dev/AIOFFICE-SearchPro`.
- **Plugin slug**: moved the Claude plugin and skill internals to the stable slug `aioffice-searchpro`, including CI paths, setup wrappers, cache directories, and Node template package names.
- **Legacy cleanup**: removed the old marketplace update hook and legacy install instructions so new installs use this repository directly.

## 0.9.5 — 2026-07-04

Windows wrapper follow-up.

- **Python selection**: `setup/run-engine.ps1` now prefers the active `python` on `PATH` before the Windows `py -3` launcher, so CI and user-managed Python environments are respected.
- **UTF-8 stdout**: the PowerShell engine wrapper forces Python UTF-8 mode while running the engine, avoiding Windows `cp1252` crashes when metadata contains symbols such as `→`.

## 0.9.4 — 2026-07-04

Windows-native setup and verification.

- **PowerShell wrappers**: added Windows companions for first-run setup, isolated engine execution, browser fallback setup, doctor checks, and live checks (`setup/*.ps1`). Windows users no longer need Git Bash just to run the plugin support scripts.
- **Windows venv defaults**: `setup/run-engine.ps1` creates the plugin runtime under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\aioffice-searchpro\venv` by default, still honoring `AIOFFICE_SEARCHPRO_VENV`, and keeps system Python untouched.
- **Cross-platform docs**: README, course install docs, platform reference, and Playwright notes now show both bash and PowerShell paths.
- **CI coverage**: added a `pwsh` smoke test for the PowerShell engine wrapper, including `--json --output --metadata` behavior.

## 0.9.3 — 2026-07-04

One-shot content capture for probabilistic WAF wins.

- **Raw content output**: added `--output` / `--save-content` to the engine CLI so the exact winning fetch result can be written to disk while `--json` still emits metadata only. This avoids the AliExpress-style failure mode where the first call succeeds, the agent re-runs to get HTML, and the second call lands on a challenge page.
- **Metadata sidecar**: added `--metadata` to write the same content-omitting JSON payload to a file, including `content_path` and `content_saved_bytes` when raw content was saved.
- **Direct-install cleanup**: first-run setup now stars the current `aidenlim-dev/AIOFFICE-SearchPro` repo when explicitly opted in.
- **Regression coverage**: added a network-free CLI test proving `--json --output --metadata` performs one fetch, saves raw content exactly, and keeps raw content out of JSON.

## 0.9.2 — 2026-07-04

Course-install hardening and release hygiene.

- **Direct GitHub marketplace**: added `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so students can install directly with `/plugin marketplace add aidenlim-dev/AIOFFICE-SearchPro` and `/plugin install aioffice-searchpro@aioffice-searchpro-marketplace`.
- **Isolated Python runtime**: `setup/run-engine.sh` now creates a plugin-owned venv and installs from `requirements.lock`, avoiding macOS/Homebrew global-pip failures.
- **Browser setup path**: added `setup/browser.sh` to install local Patchright/Playwright Chrome dependencies and register Playwright MCP when available.
- **Student support scripts/docs**: added `setup/doctor.sh`, `setup/live-check.sh`, and `COURSE_INSTALL.ko.md`.
- **CI and lockfiles**: added GitHub Actions validation, `requirements.lock`, and `engine/templates/package-lock.json`.
- **Playwright routing fix**: failure diagnostics now respect MCP vs local real-Chrome tiers instead of treating MCP as the universal final fallback.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-07-02

Activate the Patchright fallback and align the self-learning host key.

- **Patchright activated** (`engine/templates/package.json`): added `patchright` (^1.61.1) as a dependency. The real-Chrome template (`playwright_real_chrome.js`) already *preferred* `require('patchright')`, but the package was never declared, so it always fell back to playwright-extra+stealth. Patchright is a Playwright-API-compatible drop-in fork that patches the CDP `Runtime.enable` (console-attach) leak that Cloudflare/DataDome-class detection now keys on — verified end-to-end (`automation:patchright`, HTTP 200, real HTML). When patchright is absent the template still falls back to playwright-extra+stealth → plain playwright, all on `channel:'chrome'`.
- **Learning host-key fix** (`engine/learning.py`): `key_for` used `urlsplit().netloc` (keeps port + userinfo) while the session pool and Playwright profile dir key on `hostname` (`transport._host_of`, `executor._profile_dir_for`). A URL with a port therefore *learned* under a different key than it *fetched* under. Switched to `hostname` so the learned route, warm session, and browser profile all share one host key.
- **Docs**: `SKILL.md` + `references/playwright.md` install instructions updated to the local `engine/templates` npm install with `npx patchright install chrome`.
- Full engine regression 59/59; `bias_check` clean.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-06-28

Prompt-injection surface hardening for fetched public web content.

- **Content-safety metadata and envelope**: fetched text is now annotated as `untrusted_public_web`, reports deterministic prompt-injection risk signals, and the default CLI text output wraps content between collision-resistant `[BEGIN UNTRUSTED WEB CONTENT]` / `[END UNTRUSTED WEB CONTENT]` boundary lines. Python API callers still receive raw `FetchResult.content`, and can use `FetchResult.to_untrusted_text()` for the same safe agent-facing representation as the CLI; JSON output keeps content omitted and adds metadata only. This is a mitigation/packaging boundary, not blocking or complete prompt-injection prevention.
- **Risk-score calibration**: a lone topical keyword (e.g. `secret`/`token`/`password`) on an ordinary page no longer escalates to `medium`, and keyword-only signals without an explicit instruction-override now cap at `medium` instead of `high`. `high` is reserved for an instruction-override combined with a sensitive action. This avoids crying wolf on the technical/API docs this tool routinely fetches — verified against real pages (Wikipedia, MDN, Django/Stripe docs) — so the `high` label stays meaningful for genuine injection attempts.

## 0.8.1 — 2026-06-22

Validator false-positive fix — a small but complete page is no longer mislabelled a challenge.

- **`validators.py`**: the tiny-body heuristic (body < 3000B with no positive proof) used to return a decisive `CHALLENGE` on size alone, so a legitimately short page (e.g. example.com at ~600B) failed with `ok=False` even though it returned a clean 200 with real content. It now checks completeness first — a COMPLETE HTML document (`</html>`/`</body>`) carrying meaningful visible text → `WEAK_OK`; only an incomplete / script-only / empty small body stays `CHALLENGE`. New `_looks_complete_content_page` helper.
- Pre-existing since validator v2 (v0.6.0) — affected *every* complete page under 3000 bytes, not just example.com.
- Adds 3 regression cases to `tests/test_u1.py` (small-complete → weak_ok; script-stub and incomplete-fragment → challenge). Full engine regression 48/48; `bias_check` clean.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-06-22

Per-host self-learning (U5) — the engine now remembers which route got through and tries it first next time. Lab-built (`aioffice-searchpro-lab`), effect-tested before shipping.

- **`engine/learning.py` (new)** — a bounded, self-pruning JSON store (`~/.aioffice_searchpro/learned.json`, override with `AIOFFICE_SEARCHPRO_LEARNED_PATH`). For each host it records the route that last succeeded (`transform × impersonate × referer × phase`), keyed by `host::{desktop|mobile}`.
- **Promotion in the first phase** — `fetch()` is now a learning wrapper around the grid (`_fetch_core`): before fetching it looks up the host and promotes the learned route to *both* the probe identity and the front of the grid (`_build_plan` priority). On a 2nd visit the known-good route is retried first instead of being rediscovered.
- **Eviction so the store can't bloat or rot**: (1) a learned route that hits a REAL block (`exhausted`/`challenge`/`blocked`) is struck and deleted after 2 consecutive strikes — transient outcomes (429, network/unknown error, budget cut) and URL-level outcomes (404/401) never strike; (2) entries unused for 30 days are pruned on load (`AIOFFICE_SEARCHPRO_LEARN_TTL_DAYS`); (3) a 500-entry LRU cap (`AIOFFICE_SEARCHPRO_LEARN_MAX`). Disable entirely with `AIOFFICE_SEARCHPRO_LEARN=0`.
- **Safe by construction** — every learning operation is best-effort and swallows its own errors, so it can never break a fetch. It is a DATA file only, so the No-Site-Name Rule (R3) still holds (`bias_check` clean).
- **Measured** (`experiments/effect_e8.py`, offline A/B): 2nd-visit curl attempts drop (3 → 1 on a small grid; scales with grid depth), and a learning-off control matches the cold run — confirming the win comes from learning. Adds `tests/test_u5.py` (14 cases); full engine regression 45/45.

## 0.7.3 — 2026-06-22

- **5-language README** (matches the marketplace root): added `README.zh.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.es.md` (full translations) and a 5-language switcher header across all files (en · ko · zh · ja · es). The "Impossible is nothing." slogan stays in English in zh/ja/es with a localized second line.
- EN tagline gains a grounding second line: **"Impossible is nothing. If it's public, aioffice-searchpro gets in."**

## 0.7.2 — 2026-06-22

- Stronger hero tagline. EN: **"Impossible is nothing."** · KO: **"포기는 배추 셀 때나 쓰는 말. 공개된 페이지라면, aioffice-searchpro는 결국 뚫어낸다."** — the descriptive sub-line still grounds what the plugin is.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-06-22

README overhaul — image-first landing that shows what the plugin does in one glance.

- **New README (en + ko)**: replaces the 234-line manual with a ~110-line sales landing. Two cinematic hero images (a 403/CAPTCHA/WAF wall shattering as `aioffice-searchpro GETS IN`, and the Phase 0→3 escalation pipeline as an energy rail) under `assets/`. Sections: Install · Try it · Works on · Why it gets through · Default vs `+ aioffice-searchpro` · How it works · Boundaries.
- **Content preserved, not dropped**: the full platform tables, reference-file map, dependencies, and example prompts moved to `PLATFORMS.md` (linked from the README) — nothing lost, the landing just stops carrying the manual.
- Hero demo uses real, verified data (a public `@claudeai` post via WebSearch → oEmbed, no API key); the "before" reflects the actual default-fetch failure on X (HTTP 402 / a JavaScript-only shell), not a fictional login wall.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-06-22

Harness enforcement — the engine now *makes* itself try every route instead of relying on the agent to remember to. (Motivated by a live failure: `.json`/syndication 403/429'd, the agent declared Reddit/X "blocked", and nobody tried `.rss`/oEmbed.)

- **Phase 0 official-API router** (`engine/phase0.py`, new): `fetch()` now detects recognised platforms by URL and tries the official no-auth endpoint **before** the generic grid — Reddit→`.rss` (then `.json` via curl_cffi), X tweet→`cdn.syndication tweet-result` + `publish oembed`, X profile→`syndication-timeline` (retry), YouTube→`yt-dlp`. This is the *enforced* version of the old agent-driven SKILL snippets, so the route can no longer be skipped. Trace records each as `phase=phase0`; recognised-but-failed falls through to the grid (never gives up early). New `enable_phase0` param + `--no-phase0`. `phase0.py` is the single bias-check-exempt engine file (R5 sanctioned exception).
- **Failure gate** (`fetch_chain.py`, `__main__.py`): on `ok=False`, `FetchResult` now carries `untried_routes[]` and `must_invoke_playwright_mcp`. A terminal wall (404/auth/paywall) returns them empty; **429 is treated as transient** (back off + retry, not a wall); any other give-up names what's left — re-run exhaustive if the grid was budget-cut, and (always, for gated pages) drive Playwright **MCP from the agent session**, which the engine structurally cannot do itself. The CLI prints a `⛔ NOT EXHAUSTED (R6)` block to stderr. SKILL **R6** rewritten as a 4-point blocking checklist that consumes these fields. CLI `--max-attempts` now defaults to exhaustive.
- **Coverage battery** (`tests/coverage_battery.py`, new): hits each platform through ALL candidate routes and reports PASS/FAIL per route, so "did we actually try everything?" is an evidence artifact and a rotted example (was PASS, now FAIL) is caught. Current run: 6/7 reachable (reddit `.rss`, x tweet-result+oembed, youtube, hn, arxiv, naver); flags the stale `reddit json+iPhoneUA` SKILL example.
- **bias_check hardening** (`bias_check.py`): `engine/tests/**` excluded (fixtures legitimately use concrete hosts/IPs), `phase0.py` explicitly allow-listed, `safety.py` metadata-IP comment marked `NOTE-BIAS-OK`. Default scan is clean again.
- Quick-reference + engine-file guide updated: lead with `python3 -m engine <URL>` (Phase 0 is automatic); manual snippets marked debug-only with the verified working routes.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-06-22

Engine overhaul — multi-AI reviewed (GPT-5.5 Pro + council) and effect-tested before shipping.

- **Diversity scheduler** (`fetch_chain.py`): the grid now materializes a plan and varies TLS family × URL transform first, so a small attempt budget touches every family/transform instead of burning out on one. Measured: family×transform class coverage 3/10 → 10/10 at the same cap. `max_attempts=None` is now exhaustive (honours R6); `tls_impersonate_avoid` targets are deprioritized, not deleted; jitter only on a failed attempt; new `grid_exhausted` / `stop_reason` diagnostics.
- **Validator v2** (`validators.py`): adds non-terminal `SUSPECT_OK`, JSON-aware validation (small API responses no longer mislabelled `CHALLENGE`), HARD vs SOFT markers (a `captcha` word can't override a matched selector), byte-accurate size, and 429/401/404/5xx status semantics. Measured: judgment errors 5/11 → 0/11 (incl. 2 false-successes removed).
- **Per-host SessionPool + cookie bridge** (`transport.py`, `executor.py`): cookies and connections persist across attempts/pages; a browser that clears a JS challenge hands its cookies + UA to curl_cffi (FlareSolverr pattern). Proven: an injected clearance cookie converts a 403/challenge into a 200. Adds `fetch_many()` and root warmup.
- **Playwright fallback hardening**: per-host profile isolation, `process.exit` → drained natural exit (no truncated HTML), single shared navigation deadline, JSON envelope (status / final URL / cookies / UA).
- **Patchright support (additive)**: if `patchright` is installed it is used as a drop-in (Runtime.enable-free) Playwright per its official best-practice (`channel='chrome'`, `no_viewport`, no stealth/headers); otherwise behaviour is unchanged. Measured on rebrowser-bot-detector: `runtimeEnableLeak` passes, `navigator.webdriver` hidden.
- **SSRF / redirect guard** (`safety.py`): blocks non-http(s) schemes and requests/redirects to private/loopback/link-local/metadata IPs (with DNS-rebinding check); every redirect hop is validated. `INSANE_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` opts in for local use.
- **Requires curl_cffi ≥ 0.15.0**: `impersonate="chrome"` now resolves to Chrome 146 (was the stale Chrome 142), plus HTTP/3 fingerprints and an SSRF-safe redirect default. Setup and the runtime guard upgrade an existing older curl_cffi.
- Adds deterministic regression tests (`test_u1.py`, `test_u4.py`, `test_u7.py`).

## 0.5.2 — 2026-06-21

- The GitHub-star prompt is shown in the user's current language; on a fresh session with no language signal yet, it falls back to the language detected from your recent Claude sessions (else English).
- GitHub star is now **opt-in** — on first run the command asks once via AskUserQuestion (`네, ⭐ 눌러주기` / `아니요`) instead of auto-starring. The star logic moved into `setup.sh` and records the choice (`~/.aioffice-searchpro-setup/<plugin>.star.json`) so it never re-asks. `setup.sh` no longer stars anything automatically.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.1] — 2026-05-04

### Changed
- SKILL.md R7 (WAF 조기 감지 시 API-first 병행 분기) — 분기 결정은 자동이지만 사용자가 결과 metadata에서 확인 가능. 어떤 접근 경로로 성공/실패했는지 명시

### Preserved (R1-R7 모두 보존)
- R1: WebFetch / 즉흥 curl 금지
- R2: 첫 200에서 탈출 금지 (4-계층 검증)
- **R3: No-Site-Name Rule** (bias_check.py CI 게이트) — fossil-방지 메타-패턴
- R4: 사이트 고유 정보는 CLI/user_hint로만
- R5: Phase 0 공식 API 우선
- R6: 격자 모두 돌린 뒤 "뚫을 수 없음" 결론
- R7: 병행 분기

→ aioffice-searchpro는 4 진단 대상 중 fossil 의문이 가장 적게 검증된 케이스. R3 + bias_check.py는 다른 fossil-위험 플러그인에 차용 가능한 메타-패턴.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- **`engine/` Python package** — single public entrypoint (`python3 -m engine URL` or `from engine import fetch`) that runs an exhaustive curl_cffi grid over WAF product profiles.
  - `fetch_chain.py` — grid scheduler with internal phases (probe → validate → detect → plan → execute → report), per-attempt jitter, and `FetchResult.trace[]` for diagnostics.
  - `validators.py` — 4-layer challenge classifier (`STRONG_OK / WEAK_OK / CHALLENGE / BLOCKED / UNKNOWN`) replacing naive HTTP 200 heuristics.
  - `waf_detector.py` — ranked `[(profile_id, confidence)]` detection with sticky `last_load_error()` for loader diagnostics.
  - `waf_profiles.yaml` — seven product profiles (`akamai_bot_manager`, `cloudflare_turnstile`, `f5_big_ip`, `aws_waf`, `datadome_probable`, `perimeterx_human`, `unknown_challenge`) with 25+ curl_cffi impersonate candidates and an empirically-derived `tls_impersonate_avoid` list.
  - `url_transforms.py` — generic URL mutations (`original`, `mobile_subdomain`, `am_prefix`, `drop_www`), no site-specific branches.
  - `executor.py` — capability-matched Playwright router, honours each profile's `fallback_when_challenge` ordering.
  - `templates/playwright_real_chrome.js` — Local Node + `channel:'chrome'` + stealth + persistent context, with home warmup and reload-retry against Akamai-grade WAFs.
  - `templates/playwright_mobile_chrome.js` — `devices[...]` emulation while keeping real-Chrome TLS.
  - `bias_check.py` — CI linter enforcing the No-Site-Name Rule via brand denylist + URL/domain regex, with `node_modules`/build-artefact exclusion.
  - `tests/test_smoke.py` — unit + online smoke coverage for validators, profile loader, URL transforms, and network round-trips.
- **SKILL.md harness rules R1–R7** — explicit constraints that keep Claude from improvising around the engine:
  - R1 CLI-first on any blocked URL
  - R2 no early break on HTTP 200
  - R3 No-Site-Name enforcement
  - R4 runtime-only hints
  - R5 Phase 0 official APIs take precedence
  - R6 exhaustive grid before declaring failure
  - **R7 — API-first parallel branch** when a WAF is detected early and the user intent is list/collect: engine keeps running in background while Claude reconnoiters via Playwright MCP `browser_network_requests` to discover internal JSON endpoints, then re-fetches via engine.
- **Full `references/` index (12/12 files)** grouped by role (engine extension, lightweight alternatives, platform APIs, in-tree code) with "when to read" + "what it covers" per entry.
- **`references/playwright.md`** rewritten as Approach 1 (MCP Chromium — Cloudflare-grade) vs Approach 2 (Local Node `channel:'chrome'` + stealth — Akamai-grade), selection driven automatically by profile `capabilities_needed` tags.

### Changed
- `plugin.json` version bumped to `0.4.0` (new public surface + new behavior justify minor bump).
- Graceful degradation paths for missing `PyYAML`, `curl_cffi`, `bs4`, or Node — failures surface as `UNKNOWN` verdicts + trace entries, never silently swallow.
- Per-attempt jitter between curl grid calls, env-tunable via `INSANE_JITTER_MS_MIN` / `INSANE_JITTER_MS_MAX`.

### Notes
- No site-specific logic is introduced anywhere in `engine/**` or `waf_profiles.yaml`; all site knowledge enters at call time (`success_selectors`, `user_hint`) or stays in comments / docs.
- Earlier history kept in git log.

## Earlier releases

Pre-0.4.0 history is documented in git commits only; no structured changelog was maintained before this release.
